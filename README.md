# 🧠 RAG-Coder: A Framework for Augmenting Qualitative Analysis

## 📘 Description

**RAG-Coder** is a Python-based framework for semi-automating the **qualitative analysis of open-ended survey data** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** strategies with the **Google Gemini API**.

It applies a formal **codebook** to new textual data, assisting researchers in coding consistency, scalability, and reproducibility.  
The framework ensures **auditability** by generating detailed logs (audit trail, model outputs, and error reports) that support validation and transparency in empirical research.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Configure environment**

   Make sure you have a valid `config.json` in the same directory as `rag_coder.py`.

2. **Prepare input files**

   Ensure your input CSV files (e.g., `codebook.csv`, `study1.csv`) follow the schema defined in `config.json`.

3. **Set your API key**

   ```bash
   (Windows)   set GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key"
   (macOS/Linux) export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_key"
   ```

4. **Run RAG-Coder**

   ```bash
   python rag_coder.py
   ```

5. **View logs and outputs**

   Logs and model outputs will be stored automatically for reproducibility and later auditing.
